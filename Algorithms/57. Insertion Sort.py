"""
Description: You are given a list of integers. Write a Python function to sort the list in ascending 
order using the Insertion Sort algorithm. Insertion Sort works by building a sorted section of the list, one 
element at a time, by inserting each new element into its proper position within the already sorted section.

Input: lst = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
Output: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]

Input: lst = [31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58]
Output: [26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59]
