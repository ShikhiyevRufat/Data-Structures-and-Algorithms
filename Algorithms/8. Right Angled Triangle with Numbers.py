Problem Description: You are given an integer n. Your task is to return a right-angled triangle pattern 
where each row contains repeated digits. The first row contains the number 1 repeated once, the second row 
contains the number 2 repeated twice, and so on until the nth row contains the number n repeated n times.

Input: 5
Output: ['1', '22', '333', '4444', '55555']
 
Input: 3
Output: ['1', '22', '333']
