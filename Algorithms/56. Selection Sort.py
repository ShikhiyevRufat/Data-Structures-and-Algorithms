"""
Description: You are given a list of integers. Write a Python function to sort the list in ascending 
order using the Selection Sort algorithm. Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element 
from the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted part.

Input: lst = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

Input: lst = [29, 10, 14, 37, 13]
Output: [10, 13, 14, 29, 37]
