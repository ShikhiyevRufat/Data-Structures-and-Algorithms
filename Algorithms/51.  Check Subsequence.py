"""
Problem Description: You are given two strings s and t. Your task is to determine if string t is a subsequence 
of string s. A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some 
(or no) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Input: s = "abcde", t = "ace"
Output: True
 
Input: s = "abcde", t = "aec"
Output: False
