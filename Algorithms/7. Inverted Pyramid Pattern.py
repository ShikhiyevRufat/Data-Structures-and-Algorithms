"""
Problem Description: You are given an integer n. Your task is to return an inverted pyramid pattern of '*', 
where each side has n rows, represented as a list of strings. The first row has 2n - 1 stars, the second row 
has 2n - 3 stars, and so on, until the last row has 1 star, with each row centered using spaces.

Input: 3
Output: ['*****', ' *** ', '  *  ']
 
Input: 5
Output: ['*********', ' ******* ', '  *****  ', '   ***   ', '    *    ']
